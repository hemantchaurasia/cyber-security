# Penetration Testing

### What is Penetration Testing?
Penetration testing (pen test) is a proactive security assessment technique used to evaluate the security of computer systems, networks and applications.

### Five Phases of Penetration Testing:
> 1. Reconnaissance
> 2. Scanning 
> 3. Vulnerability assessment 
> 4. Exploitation
> 5. Reporting

### List of Pen Testing tools:

**1. Network Scanning and Enumeration:**
 - Nmap
 - Nessus
 - OpenVAS
 - Nikto
 - Wireshark

**2. Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment:**
- Nexpose
- Qualys
- OpenVAS
- Nessus

**3. Exploitation Frameworks:**
- Metasploit Framework
- Cobalt Strike
- Canvas
- Core Impact
- Empire

**4. Web Application Testing:**
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- Acunetix
- Netsparker
- AppScan

**5. Wireless Network Testing:**
- Aircrack-ng
- Kismet
- Wireshark
- Reaver
- Wifite

**6. Password Cracking:**
- John the Ripper
- Hashcat
- Hydra
- Medusa

**7. Social Engineering:**
- SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)
- BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)
- Gophish
- King Phisher

**8. Reporting and Documentation:**
- Dradis
- Faraday
- ReportPortal
- JIRA
- Custom templates and spreadsheets

### Programming language for penetration testing:

- **Python:** Python is a popular choice for penetration testing due to its simplicity, readability, and vast library support. It offers excellent networking and scripting capabilities, making it versatile for tasks like network scanning, exploit development, and automation of penetration testing tools.

- **Bash scripting:** Bash (Unix shell) scripting is widely used for automating repetitive tasks and creating custom scripts in penetration testing. It is especially handy for executing command-line tools and performing simple system-level tasks.

- **PowerShell:** PowerShell is a powerful scripting language for Windows environments. It provides extensive access to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and other administrative APIs, making it valuable for tasks such as privilege escalation, network reconnaissance, and automating Windows-specific tests.

- **Ruby:** Ruby is known for its ease of use and flexibility. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries, such as Metasploit, which is a widely used penetration testing framework. Ruby is particularly useful for web application testing and scripting.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is primarily used for web application security testing. It can be utilized to create browser-based attacks, automate web interactions, perform DOM manipulation, and analyze JavaScript-based vulnerabilities.

- **C/C++:** C and C++ are low-level languages that provide fine-grained control and performance. They are often used in developing exploits, reverse engineering, and conducting more advanced penetration testing tasks where lower-level access is required.
